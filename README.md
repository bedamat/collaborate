### Vegan Dog Food

Luckily, there are quite a lot of vegan-friendly foods that are safe for my little Nola to enjoy on a vegan diet

**Some of these foods include:** 

   - Dark, leafy greens (*such as spinach*)

   - Lentils

    - Rice

    - Broccoli

    - Carrots

    - Quinoa

    Certain types of beans (note: beans can cause flatulence in dogs- use beans sparingly)
